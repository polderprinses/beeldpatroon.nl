# Customizations

Customizations for the [Bootstrap](https://github.com/gethyas/bootstrap) plugin go here.

## Usage

Copy the file(s) you'd like to override from `./node_modules/@hyas/bootstrap/` and paste to `./plugins/bootstrap/`. Make sure to keep the folder structure.

Supported folders are: `assets` and `layouts`.

## Mounting settings

If needed, you can change the mountings settings in `./config/_default/module.toml`. See also the Hugo docs: [Module Config: mounts](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-config-mounts).
